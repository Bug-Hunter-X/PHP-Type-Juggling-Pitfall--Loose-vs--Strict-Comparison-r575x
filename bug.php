This PHP code demonstrates an uncommon error related to how PHP handles type juggling and comparison.  The issue arises when comparing a string that looks like a number with an actual number.

```php
$a = "1000";
$b = 1000;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo "Strings and integers are equal!\n";
} else {
  echo "Strings and integers are NOT equal!\n";
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strings and integers are identical!\n";
} else {
  echo "Strings and integers are NOT identical!\n";
}
```

The `==` operator performs loose comparison, causing PHP to automatically convert the string "1000" to an integer for comparison.  This leads to the first `if` condition being true.

However, the `===` operator performs strict comparison, checking both value and type.  Because $a is a string and $b is an integer, the strict comparison is false.
