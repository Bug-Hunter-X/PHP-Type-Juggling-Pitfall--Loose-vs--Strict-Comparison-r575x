The solution involves consistently using strict comparison (`===`) to prevent unexpected type juggling:

```php
$a = "1000";
$b = 1000;

if ($a === $b) {
  echo "Strings and integers are identical!\n";
} else {
  echo "Strings and integers are NOT identical!\n";
}

//Alternatively, use explicit type casting for safer loose comparison:

if ((int)$a == $b) {
  echo "Strings and integers are equal (after casting)!\n";
} else {
  echo "Strings and integers are NOT equal (after casting)!\n";
}
```

By using strict comparison, you eliminate the possibility of unexpected type coercion and ensure that comparisons are accurate and predictable.
